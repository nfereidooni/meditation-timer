## Description: 
The goal of this project is to create a meditation timer which is to be set before beginning your meditation sitting. Once the amount of time has been set, you will have 60 seconds to turn off your screen and get comfortable. The practice starts and ends with Tingsha chimes. Tingsha chimes are traditionally used by Tibetan Buddhists to mark the beginning and end of meditation.
